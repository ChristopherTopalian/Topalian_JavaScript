<!-- SIMILAR SCRIPT AS  js_array_of_objects_key_value_to_show_001.html -->
<!--
    shows the specified key value
    from our specified array of objects

    this script is the same as js_array_of_objects_key_value_to_show_001.html,
    except, in this version, we name our file and function more simply.

    study both scripts:
    ask this question:
    do long descriptive function names seem better?
    or
    do short and easier to write, faster to read, but not as descriptive names seem better?

    imagine a very big project:
    does keyChoice describe what the function does adequately?
    or
    does keyValueToShow describe what the function does more accurately?

    always remember that long descriptive function names make more sense than shorter names,
    that are not as descriptive, but, make sure to keep the names 4 words or less,
    for easy readability as well.

    summary: keep function names descriptive, but with 4 words as less, as a goal.
    file names should be descriptive too, but with 8 words or less, as a goal.
